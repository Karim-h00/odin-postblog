# React messages/posts

the project that I learned most of react on
-states
-routing
-side effects

message1 was first iteration, all of the logic in one place, very messy, spaghetti code

message2 is the second, mostly the same but cleaned up for readability,
functions were added to closures

Messages: the last one, divided some of the logic into components
